          <p>Hi 👋  I'm Stitch. This is my resumé and an overview of how I work.</p>
          <!-- <p>A seasoned Senior Technical Product Manager, I bring a wealth of experience in steering the end-to-end product lifecycle with a strong emphasis on technological innovation. Over the course of 15 years in the industry, I have consistently demonstrated a knack for translating complex technical concepts into successful, market-leading products.
            My strategic mindset is reflected in my ability to craft and execute product roadmaps that align seamlessly with overarching business objectives. I have a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams through the intricacies of product development, leveraging my technical acumen to bridge the gap between engineering, design, and business units.</p> -->
          <br>
            <p>I’m a people-first, remote-first product and business leader with 13+ years of Enterprise and Startup experience guiding and working with empowered teams across a variety of Platform, B2B, and B2C industries (including 10 years at Apple).</p>
            <br>
            <p>I thrive when making a positive impact, working with dynamic, diverse teams to develop business and product strategies, then collaborating with them to build products that are useful and valuable to the business. I further contribute to creating and executing Go-to-Market functions that ensure consistent and sustainable business growth. As a servant leader, I believe in developing cultures and software development processes that help teams do the best work of their lives in environments that are safe, healthy, and fulfilling.</p>
