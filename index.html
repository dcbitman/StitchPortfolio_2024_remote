          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hi 👋  I'm Stitch. This is my resumé and an overview of how I work.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I’m a people-first, remote-first product leader with 13+ years of experience in Enterprise and startups building with, coaching and empowering teams to deliver a variety of B2B, B2C, and Developer-centric platforms and products.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I thrive when making a positive impact, working with dynamic, diverse teams to develop business and product strategies, then collaborating to build lovable products that are valuable to the business. I further contribute to creating and executing Go-to-Market functions that ensure consistent and sustainable business growth. As a servant leader, I believe in fostering a culture and developing software processes that empower teams to do their best work in positive, safe environments.</p>
            <br>

              <img src="../img/Stitch_rainbow_full_crop.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" class="tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Ready for pride 🏳️‍🌈">
            </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 pt-4 pt-lg-0 content" data-aos="fade-left">
            <p>I joined the tech industry holding a BA in English and with no formal technical training. But I'm entrepreneurial, inquisitive and a quick learner, and I was determined to do work that inspired and challenged me. In 2009 I found my tribe in Austin, TX, relocated and paused career development to explore the city and pursue personal projects. That year I started an event production company, created immersive experiences with thematic set designs and safe spaces for 600+ attendees per event. I also delved into clothing design, creating costumes with el wire and learning to program Raspberry Pi with Arduino. This transformative year of personal and creative growth gave me much-needed perspective on my career potential.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The next year I started at Apple and found myriad opportunities and problems that I was (gratefully) entrusted to explore autonomously and resolve on a global scale. I kept pulling the thread to discover more ways to make a positive impact, ultimately finding my career path as a technical product and people manager.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once I grok a thing I work to make it accessible to others, sustainably and equitably sharing knowledge. I create professional content, manage products, provide technical and business context, and support training. I enjoy bringing people together in collaboration and am passionate about process improvement. I take an empathetic and comprehensive approach to product and team development, enabling me to build a career I love with people I admire.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For over 13 years, I've honed my skills in people and product management, focusing on enhancing technical acumen – specifically in AI, ML, and automation, operations, and relationships. For example, I built this website over a couple of months by collaborating with friends, reading help guides and community forums, and leveraging AI tools to understand and debug issues. I absolutely love designing and get excited at any opportunity to build, especially with other passionate engineers and designers.</p>

         <p>"It's not just about continuously improving our products, it's about continuously improving our practices." – Teresa Torres</p>
         <br> 
         <p>Over my career, I've been fortunate to manage a variety of products ranging from Apple internal systems to AI and ML-powered SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS platforms for the Department of Defense. Below are highlights of the projects and products I'm most proud of.</p>

            <!-- <p class="description">Redesigned and modernized Apple's CRM iLog, evolved from a collection of legacy interfaces to an NLP-powered platform that supports millions of Apple customers daily</p> -->
            <p class="description">Initially developed for iPod cases, iLog had scalability limitations and lacked necessary accessibility features for Apple's commitment to inclusivity. My role evolved from managing backend enhancements to leading UI/UX redesign and modernization of the platform to improve support for Apple customers and AppleCare Advisors globally. Drawing on my experience as a former Advisor, I developed a more intuitive interface and redesigned login process to increase Advisor productivity and satisfaction, aligning with Apple's consumer-facing products and tailored to CRM workflows.</p>
            <p class="description">My analysis of iLog's utilization using SQL, Tableau, and Power BI revealed inefficiencies in support delivery and case logging. Through ethnographic research, I identified discrepancies in support interaction styles across regions, prompting a more nuanced approach to case handling. Collaborating with regional teams, we improved support content accuracy through information design improvements and the introduction of NLP-powered automatic search using real-time customer interactions. These efforts resulted in reduced login times, increased Advisor efficiency, and improved user satisfaction, ultimately leading to a significant advancement in iLog's interface and backend systems.</p>

            <!-- <p class="description">Identified the right solution for Apple's First Global Chat & Integrations Platform, enhanced Slack for Enterprise, and transformed Apple corporate operations</p> -->
            <p class="description">Upon recognizing my efforts within the IS&T department, which oversees Apple's third-party application suite, I was recruited to lead the selection and deployment of Apple's first global chat and integrations platform. This project aimed to centralize communications and streamline work processes across departments, replacing isolated chat servers and email, the then-gold standard of communication within Apple. As a senior technical product manager, I spearheaded the proof of concept, negotiated with vendors, and managed the technical aspects of the project. The goal was to implement a secure and scalable communication solution for Apple's workforce of over 200,000 employees and contractors worldwide.</p>
            <p class="description">We carefully analyzed, tested, and compared potential platforms against Apple's strict requirements for security, scalability, and usability to find a solution that met the company's immediate and long-term goals. After thorough evaluation, Slack emerged as the preferred choice, offering the best balance of usability, security, and cost. I led a team in customizing Slack for Apple, negotiating contracts, managing feature development, and ensuring a smooth rollout with compressive runbooks. Our project successfully enhanced internal communication and met Apple's goal of improving work experience and business operations with familiar and trusted tools.</p>

            <!-- <p class="description">Developed and integrated bots and apps to educate and protect 200+K Apple employees on Slack at Apple</p> -->
            <p class="description"><strong>HelpBot –&nbsp;</strong>I co-developed HelpBot with a team of engineers to optimize Slack usage for Apple employees. Using NLP, Knowledge Base insights, and semantic maps, we created a solution that simulates conversations and provides personalized support. HelpBot includes FAQ, training modules, and integrates with Radar (ServiceNow architecture) for support tickets. In testing, HelpBot reduced support touchpoints by 15% in its launch month, proving the effectiveness of AI and machine learning in internal support processes.</p>
            <p class="description"><strong>DisclosureBot – &nbsp;</strong>I championed the development and integration of DisclosureBot to enhance Apple's security and secrecy frameworks while deploying Slack. The bot streamlined NDA signing within Slack, increasing signings by 3000% and improving NDA record integrity and accessibility. This transition to online NDA management aligns with Apple's commitment to security and confidentiality.</p>
            <p class="description"><strong>Calendar (API) – &nbsp;</strong>I managed the development of the Apple Calendar API integration to Slack which enables in-app scheduling based on Slack user groups and channel members, providing user visibility into member availability at a glance and in a user friendly view for groups of participants.</p>
            <p class="description"><strong>Radar – &nbsp;</strong>In preparation for an expected increase in ticket volumes related to the Slack for Apple initiative, I led the effort to integrate Radar into Slack. This integration allowed users to manage Radar tickets directly within Slack through slash commands, simplifying the issue reporting process. By implementing this integration, users were able to submit issues more easily without needing to contact IS&T, which improved support efficiency. The strategic integration of Radar into Slack not only streamlined the process for users to report and track issues, but also provided valuable insights into user behaviors related to issue reporting and resolution. By allowing users to capture and communicate issue details directly within Slack, the integration greatly improved the support teams' ability to understand and address user needs. This advancement in support processes led to a more effective issue resolution and enhanced user satisfaction with the Slack for Apple program.</p>

          <h3>ThreadFix SaaS Container Security</h3>
          <br>
          <p>ThreadFix was originally designed to ingest and merge software application scanner findings into a concise list of vulnerabilities, organized by severity and risk, to enable DevOps teams to focus developer remediation efforts on the issues that mattered most. Applications are built with images and containers, which may have vulnerabilities or fail to meet compliance requirements.</p>
      
          <p>Recognizing the growing demand among customers to preempt vulnerabilities in the application build process, I led a cross-functional team in conceptualizing and executing a solution that not only aligned with our users' evolving needs but also propelled ThreadFix toward a more sustainable and competitive future.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Business & Technical Requirements</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop a new ThreadFix product to enhance Container Security capabilities, consolidating vulnerabilities and presenting detailed vulnerability insights from image and container scans</li>
            <li>Ensure seamless integration of Container Security design with existing ThreadFix UI/UX, transitioning from legacy AngularJS to a modern, sustainable framework</li>
            <li>Implement unique ThreadFix features for comprehensive vulnerability mapping between applications, images, and containers</li>
            <li>Adopt microservices architecture to move away from monolithic systems</li>
            <li>Position product strategically as SaaS-enabled segment, laying groundwork for entire ThreadFix platform transition to SaaS</li>
            <li>Aim for MVP deliverable within 9 months to secure DOD contract, covering concept to production launch journey</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Developing ThreadFix Container Security from 0-1 required thorough research conducted by my design and engineering teams, comprising mostly of new hires. This involved several months of work to identify challenges and potential solutions for delivering this new capability to the market.</p>
          <p>Our goal was to understand image and container variations, how asset details were surfaced in scanners (e.g., Prisma Cloud, Anchore, Snyk), and how to effectively manage image versions despite inconsistent versioning practices.</p>
          <p>As a remote team, we hosted virtual workshops and devoted substantial time to collaborative brainstorming. We thoroughly discussed and designed a model to efficiently handle and add value to the image and container vulnerability resolution process.</p>
          <p>To develop this unique product, I created a customized Agile framework and best practices tailored to the organization and team dynamics. These changes were implemented with the Engineering and Development team, initiating an experiment in process development, tools integration, and automation. Eventually, these improvements were adopted throughout the entire company.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Product Discovery and Development Methods</strong></p>
          <p>Fortunately, our existing customers expressed their need for a solution to the problem of image and container vulnerability visibility. However, each organization had its own unique way of managing images and repos, along with different requirements and priorities for managing vulnerabilities and risk configuration.</p>
          <p>In addition, our small organization was working on multiple large projects that could affect future acquisition opportunities. We had a significant backlog of technical debt and were also focusing on transitioning to microservices and building a SaaS version of ThreadFix. Furthermore, there were organizational challenges regarding work styles and the adoption of Agile methodology.</p>
          <p>Introducing Container Security was a crucial step for the company. To streamline our efforts, I developed a clear product vision, a concise roadmap, and an MVP scope that incorporated key functionality to experiment with microservices architecture and SaaS enablement. This approach helped us prioritize our goals and manage our technical debt effectively, and involved the following key activities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conducted market analysis, including interviews with customers and scan partners, to identify unique segment needs and determine the target personas and use cases for Container Security features. Also identified how ThreadFix could differentiate from competitors and provide a valuable solution</li>
            <li>Identified integration opportunities, blockers, and areas for improvement to recommend to scan providers for smoother integration with ThreadFix and customer technologies, processes, and reporting</li>
            <li>Prioritized features and determined target scope for the MVP DOD deliverable using Weighted Scoring, User Story Mapping, and RICE methodologies</li>
            <li>Validated ThreadFix UI/UX enhancements and Container Security vulnerability management logic and workflows through beta testing and customer feedback during development</li>
          </ul>

         <p><strong>Key discoveries</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer organizations faced challenges in adopting best practices for managing vulnerability scan results related to images and containers</li>
            <li>Inconsistencies in image and container versioning and organization were prevalent across organizations</li>
            <li>Scan results lacked reliable identifiers to automate relationships between images, containers, and the applications they were used to build, represented in ThreadFix</li>
            <li>Differences in risk and severity customization among scan providers complicated vulnerability reporting</li>
            <li>Unique vulnerability types associated with images and containers returned attributes that were not supported in ThreadFix, adding complexity to vulnerability management efforts</li>

      <p><strong>ThreadFix Container Security MVP scope</strong></p>
      <p>Having identified the Department of Defense (DOD) and Enterprise customers as ThreadFix's ideal customer personas (ICP), I focused on fulfilling DOD requirements to secure a $1.5M contract and fund three years of development. I aligned strategies with the DOD and Enterprise customers, tailoring our product development to their needs. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>To meet customer demands within the DOD's timeline, I prioritized low-cost, high-data-visibility features, including</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Displaying scan results alongside existing application vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Table filters and sorting to enable users to view vulnerabilities from multiple perspectives and generate custom reporting</li>
        <li>A way to associate images to applications in ThreadFix, which would enable assessing image/container impact on application security and proactive remediation efforts</li>
        <li>Prominently displaying image and container tags and sha hashes to enable identification and deduplication</li>
        <li>Integrated Defect Tracker solutions (Jira, Azure DevOps) and IDE integration for assigning findings to the development team</li>
        <li>Bulk vulnerability selection for reporting and assignment to developers for remediation</li>
        <li>Updating the frontend to a modern framework, selecting React for its speed, scalability, flexibility, and rich interface support</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>During Container Security development, I championed and managed POCs and experiements to support the new product, such as</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A POC for selecting the framework and libraries to support long-term ThreadFix UI/UX enhancements</li>
        <li>Collaboration with enterprise customers and scan providers Prisma Cloud Compute and Anchore for an image/container authoring solution at commit to improve attribution and vulnerability backtracing</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Results & Success Metrics</strong></p>
      <p>The team and I delivered the ThreadFix Container Security MVP to the DOD on time, meeting Authority to Operate (ATO) container hardening requirements for addition to the Defense Innovation Marketplace (DTIC). Key metrics for this initial delivery included DOD adoption, an increase in customer CSAT, and stability in client contracts (acquisition/retention). Ultimately, we wanted to see a significant reduction in image, container, and application vulnerabilities in the DevOps pipeline between dev, staging, and production build stages. We met and exceeded our goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DOD adopted ThreadFix MVP build on DTIC Marketplace and completed $1.5M payout for MVP completion</li>
        <li>The updated interface was positively received by existing and prospective customers in feedback and as reflected in NPS scores</li>
        <li>Customer retention increased by 5% and customer acquisition increased by 4%</li>
        <li>Customers added applications to ThreadFix after the Container Security release to benefit from the application context alongside image and container vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Most importantly, customers reported a reduction in application vulnerabilities after adopting Container Security and using it to examine and remediate vulnerabilities found in application image/container repos</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Here are some images from our concept work, many of which were developed into final UI/UX changes</p>

          <h3>ThreadFix Queue Management</h3>
          <br>
          <p>My initial project at Denim Group involved enhancing the ThreadFix Queue Management UI/UX to showcase its rapid intake and merge technologies while addressing performance perception issues stemming from integrated scanner API processing. Through the CIRCLES methodology, I assessed requirements and prioritized features to differentiate ThreadFix core functionality from partner integration activities. Key discoveries included unclear error reporting and lack of visibility into scan import progress. My solution scope aimed to provide a distinct UI experience for partner integrations, improve error messages, and enhance scan ingestion visibility without alienating integration partners.</p>
            <br>
          <p>By delivering the solution within six months and aligning with contract renewal timelines, the team and I successfully renewed customer confidence in ThreadFix and acquired five new customers. The revamped UI, featuring a live ingestion view and historical reporting, addressed legacy issues and contributed positively to the Coalfire acquisition negotiation, demonstrating ROI potential for future ThreadFix enhancements. Backend changes to the queuing and processing workflow further optimized performance, culminating in a streamlined MVP deliverable that met client needs and exceeded expectations.</p>

          <br>
          <p>I built this site on my machine by learning how to develop and host it locally before sharing with you. The version you're seeing is hosted on Netlify for added security and ease of use through GitHub integration.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This site has been a labor of love and, like all well-loved things, it has flaws. To meet my self-imposed deadline and begin gathering real-world feedback, I've published this site with a few issues, I hope they are tolerable and forgivable (please give your UI/UX person a cookie for responsiveness development). I'm committed to providing you with the best possible user experience while teaching myself how to build this site better.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I've listed known issues below, and will update this list as I resolve them. If you find an issue not listed, kindly let me know in an email <a href="mailto:ruestitch+product@gmail.com?subject=Stitch%20Product%20Management" target="_blank">ruestitch+product@gmail.com</a> and you might see it appear on this list!</p>

        <div>
         <h5>Responsiveness</h5>
          <p>
          <ul>
          <li>This site template is optimized for Desktop viewing and has some scaling issues – the hero text container is all over the place on smaller screens. This issue is mostly cosmetic, please view on desktop for the best experience.</li>
          <li>Resume accordion chevrons don't want to be right justified in views larger than 768px. This is my white whale currently. Please excuse them hurling themselves right on expansion on larger screens.</li>
          <li>Expanded accordion sections don't scroll elegantly to position the content at top of view area. This vexes me but I will resolve it if it's the last thing I do. I apologize for additional scrolling.</li>
          <li>If you view my Resume section on mobile, expect to have to click twice to expand accordions the first time. It's not you, it's Javascript mouseevent conflicting with hover behavior.</li>
          </ul></p>
          <br>
         
         <h5>Navigation</h5>
         <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I plan to add a mobile navigation bottom menu so you don't have to tap the hamburger and deal with that giant left nav bar dominating smaller screens. Thank you, mobile users, for your patience.</li>
          </ul>
         </p>

         <h5>Light/Dark Mode</h5>
         <p>
